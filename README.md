### Reflections and Comments

* I guess I kind of lost track of time and just kind of lost myself in designing my page. An important note is that I decided to get a little extra and make separate pages for the pages in the nav bar, which means I spread out some of the picture assets across multiple pages. Mostly the deviant is the T-Shirt picture which I threw just on the Merch page. Clicking the logo in the header takes you back to index.html.
